        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="IMG_3541.jpg" alt="Your Image">
        <p>Hello! I'm Tezreec Nicholls, an IT Project Manager and Scrum Master based in London. With a diligent and agile approach, I hold certifications in AgilePM and SCRUM, along with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C. If you'd like to see how I coded this website and many more, please head over to my <a href="https://github.com/TJNicholls" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in translating complex concepts into actionable deliverables and have extensive experience in cloud migration, re-platforming, and product development projects. </p>
            
        <p>Currently, I volunteer as an IT Project Manager at Free UK Genealogy, where I lead multiple website and software development projects using Agile methodologies. I excel in stakeholder management, cost optimization, and on-time project delivery, collaborating effectively across Information Security, Infrastructure, Corporate IT, Product, and Software Development teams within agile environments.</p>
            
        <p>Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about continuous learning and personal growth. Despite my educational background being in Theatre, TV, and Film, I've pursued certifications in Computer Science from Harvard University and am currently pursuing a Masters degree in FinTech and Finance at Greenwich University. I am also actively learning Spanish and exploring topics like mindfulness and the 12 universal laws.</p>
            
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction and engaging in activities such as pilates, yoga, and boxing, which help me maintain a healthy work-life balance. My diverse interests fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills, making me an adaptable and resourceful professional.</p>

            <h3>Project 2 - Interactive COVID-19 Information board.</h3>
            <p>This project was solicited by DDB Rememdy, a creative healthcare agency. They requested an interactive COVID-19 Information board. This webpage includes embedded videos and powerpoints, hyperlinks, company information, live data and medical statistics. <br>I was given a specific colour scheme to follow and specific media to use. They had a very clear idea of exactly how this webpage should look, my job was to bring that vision to life. In order to achieve this I used a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript</p>
